			Breaking Paragraphs into Lines (BPIL)
		</div>
		<div class="subheading">
			Line breaking is performed according to the line breaking algorithm by Knuth-Plass's Breaking Paragraphs into Lines. BPIL determines the break position considering the balance of the whole block. BPIL is available in AH Formatter V7.0 or later.
		</div>
		<ul>
		BPIL is applied to the following blocks:
			<li>
				Blocks with <span class = "codePrint">-ah-line-break: bpil;</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				Blocks with no algorithm specified by ‘axf:line-break’ but its language is specified by ‘bpil’ in the Option Setting File
			</li>
			<div>
				If <span class = "codePrint">-ah-line-break: line;</span> is specified, line breaking is performed one by one by a simple algorithm.
				<p>
					In ‘bpil’ of the Option Setting File, specifies a language or script to apply BPIL to the line breaking algorithm by separating each code with a space. The default value is ‘Latn Grek Cyrl’. When a script is specified, it is considered that the language for which it is a representative script has been specified.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, depending on certain conditions, BPIL may not apply. See Line Breaking for details. This result is not justified, as the width of the space is clear. The width of the space at the end of the line is more even when BPIL processing is applied.
				</p>
			</div>
		</ul>
		
		<div style = "margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; span: all;">
			This result is not justified, as the width of the space is clear. The width of the space at the end of the line is more even when BPIL processing is applied.
