				Here is an example of setting the side float by specifying <span class = "codePrint">-ah-float: start</span>, <span class = "codePrint">-ah-float: end</span>.  The first 2 examples show that the text body is wrapping around the float. The latter 2 examples show that the text does not wrap around the float because <span class = "codePrint">-ah-float</span> is being arranged in the indent of left and right of the text body.
