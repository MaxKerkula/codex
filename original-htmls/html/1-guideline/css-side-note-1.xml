        <p>Making sidenotes is possible using the <s:property><a href="https://www.antenna.co.jp/AHF/help/en/ahf-ext.html#ah-float">-ah-float</a></s:property> and <s:property><a href="https://www.antenna.co.jp/AHF/help/en/ahf-ext.htm#ah-float">-ah-float-offset-x</a></s:property> extension properties. This first page shows ordinary footnotes that do not use these properties. The following pages show sidenotes generated from elements that do use these properties.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are positioned using <s:rule>@sidenote</s:rule> rules within <s:rule>@page</s:rule> rules. Even-numbered pages have sidenotes in the left-hand margin and odd-numbered pages have sidenotes in the right-hand margin.</p>
