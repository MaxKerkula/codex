				Adding spaces between blocks
		</h1>
		<div class="description"><p>
				 Space between blocks can optionally be added with <span class = "codePrint">-ah-margin-after</span> and <span class = "codePrint">-ah-margin-before</span>. The following example uses <span class = "codePrint">-ah-margin-after</span> to add a 2mm space between the blocks for a question and its answer, and a 10mm space between the questionâ€“answer pairs.
