			Ordinarily, a page break occurs only when the text extends to the bottom of the page. However, it is possible to impose keep conditions relative to different blocks and place them in the same page. There placed Q3 in the end of the second page and A relative to Q3 is placed at the top of the third page. This is an ordinary placement. In contrast, on page 4 and page 5, A and relative  Q is placed in the same page without fail. By using <span class = "codePrint">-ah-keep-together.within-page: always;</span>, or <span class = "codePrint">-ah-keep-together.within-column: always;</span>. Itâ€™s possible to impose keep conditions relative to different blocks and place them in the same page.
