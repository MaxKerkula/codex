			Reduce unnecessary forced breaks

		<div class="subheading">
			<span class = "codePrint">break-before</span> and <span class = "codePrint">break-after</span> force a page break or column break. However, ‘axf:break-distance’ reduces unnecessary breaks by disabling ‘break-before’ and ‘break-after’ if there is sufficient space on the page. ‘axf:break-distance’ is specified as either a length or a percentage of the height of the containing block.
			A page break or column break specified by ‘break-before’ or ‘break-after’ is enabled only when the height of the remaining area is less than the ‘axf:break-distance’ height. If the height of the remaining area is greater than the height specified by ‘axf:break-distance’, no page breaks or column breaks are made. ‘axf: break-distance’ is available in Antenna House Formatter V7.3 and later.
		</div>
		<div>
			In the next page, <span class = "codePrint">break-before: column;</span> is specified on blocks in a two-column page. If only <span class = "codePrint">break-before: column;</span> is specified, the column breaks there. However, if ‘axf:break-distance’ is also specified, the height of the column will determine whether or not to break the column.

				There are two columns here.
			</div>
			<div style = "break-before: column; -ah-margin-before: 1.5em;">
				The block has <span class = "codePrint">break-before: column</span>, which normally forces a column break. This caused the large space in the previous column.

				The following three blocks are identical.
			</div>
			<div style = "-ah-break-distance: 30%; -ah-margin-before: 1.5em;">
				This block has <span class = "codePrint">-ah-break-distance: 30%;</span>. A forced break occurs only if the height of the remaining area is less than the <span class = "codePrint">-ah-break-distance</span> value.
			</div>
			<div style = "-ah-margin-before: 1.5em; -ah-margin-before: 1.5em;">
				This block has <span class = "codePrint">break-before: column;</span> and <span class = "codePrint">-ah-break-distance: 30%;</span> A forced break occurs only if the height of the remaining area is less than the <span class = "codePrint">-ah-break-distance</span> value.
