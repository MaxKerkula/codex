        <p>Making sidenotes is possible using the <a href="https://www.antenna.co.jp/AHF/help/en/ahf-ext.html#ah-float">-ah-float</a> and <a href="https://www.antenna.co.jp/AHF/help/en/ahf-ext.htm#ah-float">-ah-float-offset-x</a> CSS properties. This first page shows ordinary footnotes that do not use these properties. The following pages show sidenotes generated from elements that do use these properties.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are positioned using the <code>@sidenote</code> page margin box selector on <code>@page</code> rules. Even-numbered pages have sidenotes on the left-hand side and odd-numbered pages have sidenotes on the right-hand side.</p>
